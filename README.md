# Predicting-Cancer-Diagnosis-using-Classification-Models
## Project Objective:
In honor of Breast Cancer Awareness Month, this project aims to develop and evaluate machine learning models to classify breast cancer tumors as either malignant or benign. The project will involve:
1. Understanding the dataset and performing necessary data cleanup.
2. Building classification models and fine-tuning hyperparameters.
3. Comparing evaluation metrics to determine the most accurate and efficient model.
This project is dedicated to raising awareness and advancing early diagnosis efforts in the fight against breast cancer.
## Tools Used
1. Python
2. Power BI
## Data 
The data used in this was downloaded from kaggle.Download [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/breast-cancer-dataset)
- Breast cancer is the most common cancer amongst women in the world. It accounts for 25% of all cancer cases, and affected over 2.1 Million people in 2015 alone. It starts
  when cells in the breast begin to grow out of control. These cells usually form tumors that can be seen via X-ray or felt as lumps in the breast area.
- The key challenges against itâ€™s detection is how to classify tumors into malignant (cancerous) or benign(non cancerous).
  ### Data description:
  The data has the following columns:
  1. id - This is the unique identifier for each patient or observation.
  2. diagnosis - The diagnosis of breast cancer, indicating whether the cancer is Malignant (M) or Benign (B).
  3. radius_mean - The average distance from the center to points on the perimeter of the nucleus. This provides a measureof     the size of the cell nuclei.
  4. texture_mean - The standard deviation of gray-scale values, capturing the variation in the texture or smoothness of the     surface of the cell nuclei.
  5. perimeter_mean - The average perimeter of the cell nucleus. A larger perimeter generally correlates with a larger,           possibly malignant cell.
  6. area_mean - The average area of the cell nucleus. Larger cell areas are more likely to be malignant.
  7. smoothness_mean - The mean of local variations in the radius lengths. It measures how smooth the edges of the cell           nucleus are. Less smoothness might indicate malignancy.
  8. compactness_mean -This captures how compact the cell nucleus is. Less compactness may be a sign of malignancy.
  9. concavity_mean - The mean extent of concave (inward-curved) portions of the cell nucleus boundary. Larger concavities        are associated with malignant cells.
  10. concave points_mean - The mean number of concave points (points where the perimeter curves inward) on the boundary of        the cell nucleus. More concave points suggest malignancy.
  11. symmetry_mean - The mean measure of how symmetric the cell nucleus is. Malignant cells often exhibit more asymmetry.
  12. fractal_dimension_mean - The mean "coastline" fractal dimension, which quantifies the complexity of the boundary.            Malignant cells tend to have more complex, irregular boundaries.
  13. radius_se - The standard error of the radius measurements. Higher values indicate variability in cell sizes, which may       indicate malignancy.
  14. texture_se - The standard error of texture measurements, indicating variability in surface texture.
  15. perimeter_se - The standard error of the perimeter measurements. Higher values reflect variability in the cell               boundaries.
  16. area_se - The standard error of the area measurements. Large variability in cell areas is often associated with              malignancy.
  17. smoothness_se - The standard error of smoothness measurements, reflecting variability in edge smoothness.
  18. compactness_se - The standard error of compactness measurements, indicating variability in how tightly packed the cell       is.
  19. concavity_se - The standard error of concavity measurements, showing the variability in the inward curvature of the          cell boundaries.
  20. concave points_se - The standard error of the number of concave points, reflecting the variability in boundary               concavities.
  21. symmetry_se - The standard error of symmetry measurements, indicating how variable the symmetry is between different         cells.
  22. fractal_dimension_se - The standard error of fractal dimension measurements, capturing the variability in boundary           complexity.
  23. radius_worst - The largest mean radius observed across all cells.
  24. texture_worst - The worst texture measurement, representing the most extreme variation in surface smoothness among the       cells.
  25. perimeter_worst - The largest perimeter measurement observed, indicating the most extreme cell size.
  26. area_worst - The largest area measurement observed across cells.
  27. smoothness_worst - The worst smoothness value, representing the least smooth or roughest cell boundary.
  28. compactness_worst - The most extreme compactness value observed.
  29. concavity_worst - The largest concavity observed, representing the cell with the most inward curvature.
  30. concave points_worst - The most concave points observed across cells.
  31. symmetry_worst - The least symmetric cell observed.
  32. fractal_dimension_worst - The most complex or irregular cell boundary observed across all cells.
  ### Data cleaning
1. Checked for missing values - there were no missing values.
2. Checked for duplicates - there were no duplicates
3. Checked for errors, and data types to ensure consistency and acuracy of the data.
   - Since the diagnosis column is of string data type, I
