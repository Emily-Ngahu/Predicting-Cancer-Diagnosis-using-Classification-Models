# Predicting-Cancer-Diagnosis-using-Classification-Models
## Project Objective:
In honor of Breast Cancer Awareness Month, this project aims to develop and evaluate machine learning models to classify breast cancer tumors as either malignant or benign. The project will involve:
1. Understanding the dataset and performing necessary data cleanup.
2. Building classification models and fine-tuning hyperparameters.
3. Comparing evaluation metrics to determine the most accurate and efficient model.
This project is dedicated to raising awareness and advancing early diagnosis efforts in the fight against breast cancer.
